## Installation üßô

```
pip install wizardry
```

## Usage üè¶

There is 3 commands in Wizardry CLI:

- ```wizardry framework``` enables user to define an **alpha**, an **universe**, a **portfolio construction** and a **risk managment model** to build the body of your strategy

- ```wizardry library``` enables user to **explore** and **"fork"** to their local machine about **100 algo trading strategies** from this [webpage](https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/strategy-library/strategy-library)

- ```wizardry backtest``` Backtesting is not available for the moment but this command line will guide you on **how to backtest your code to Quantconnect!**

Before going into details for each of these commands, **click on the image below to see a demo/tutorial of Wizardry**

So, let's get into these 3 commands

### wizardry framework

It follows the same process than Quantconnect (+few extra features) :

- üçà **Universe Selection :** Select your assets
- üçì **Alpha Creation :** Generate trading signals
- üçá **Portfolio Construction :** Determine position size targets
- üçâ **Execution :** Place trades to reach your position sizes
- üçå **Risk Management :** Manage the market risks

### wizardry backtest

Here is how I advise you to backtest your strategy made on Wizardry :

For the first time:

1. run ```pip install lean``` in an empty folder

2. run ```lean login``` in this same directory with the command prompt and give your QuantConnect ID and API token (you can get them [here](https://www.quantconnect.com/settings/))

3. run ```lean create-project "Project Name"``` in the same directory with your command prompt

4. Replace the ```main.py``` file in the "Project Name" folder by your ```main.py```

5. run ```lean cloud push --project "Project Name"```

6. finally, run ```lean cloud backtest "Project Name" --open --push'``` (just repeat this command when modifying the file)

You're done!üöÄ
